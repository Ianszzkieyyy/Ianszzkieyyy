## Hi there, I'm Ian! 👋

## 👨‍💻 About Me
I am an aspiring Full Stack Software Engineer. Currently a Junior from Bulacan State University (Philippines) studying Computer Engineering. 

I am passionate about computers and the emerging technologies that are shaping the way we live today.

I not only love creating software, but I also take pride in partaking in the challenges it took to architect them.

I have come to love the cycle of learning, failing, and trying again,.
